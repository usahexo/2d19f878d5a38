#  Illinois Poised to Become Nation's Top Sports Betting Market

The state of Illinois is on the brink of becoming the top sports betting market in the country.

Numerous casinos and racetracks throughout the state are now offering sports betting, and officials say that interest in the new form of gambling has been brisk.

Illinois is one of a handful of states where sports betting is currently legal, and analysts say that its potential market is far larger than that of any other state.

"Illinois is a huge state, with more than 12 million residents," said John Pappas, executive director of the Poker Players Alliance. "There's a lot of money to be made in sports betting there."

Most of Illinois' casinos and racetracks are located near Chicago, the country's third-largest city. That means that many people who live in or near Chicago will have easy access to legal sports betting.

Lawmakers in Illinois had initially been reluctant to legalize sports betting, but they eventually changed their minds after seeing the success that other states were having.

"We looked at what was happening in New Jersey and Delaware and other states, and we saw that there was a lot of money to be made," said State Representative Lou Lang (D-Skokie). "We wanted to make sure that we didn't miss out on that."

Sports betting has quickly become one of the most popular forms of gambling in the United States. In recent years, several states have legalized it, and its popularity is only expected to grow in the years ahead.

#  Chicago Bears Could Benefit the Most from Sports Betting in Illinois

The Chicago Bears are one of the most popular teams in the NFL, and their fans are some of the most passionate in the country. Given that, it’s unsurprising that many people are interested in betting on the Bears.

Unfortunately, up until now, there hasn’t been a way to do that legally in Illinois. But that could be changing very soon.

Illinois legislators are currently considering a bill that would legalize sports betting in the state. If passed, the Bears would likely benefit more than any other team in Illinois.

That’s because Bears fans are already very familiar with betting on their team. A study by WalletHub found that Bears fans are among the most likely in the country to bet on NFL games.

And those bets aren’t just made by casual fans either. A majority of those who bet on the Bears do so with serious intent. In fact, more than 60% of Bears bettors have placed at least five bets on NFL games over the past three seasons.

That level of engagement is something that sportsbook operators would love to tap into. And it’s something that the Bears could certainly use to their advantage.

There’s no doubt that legalizing sports betting would be a major boon for both the state and its teams. It would generate millions of dollars in tax revenue for Illinois, and it would also create new jobs and economic opportunities for residents across the state.

But none of those things would matter if people didn’t have an interest in betting on sports. And thanks to the passion of Bears fans, there’s no doubt that they would be one of the biggest beneficiaries of legalized sports betting in Illinois.

#  How Much Revenue Will Illinois Generate From Sports Betting?

On May 14, 2019, the Illinois Senate voted 43-12 in favor of legalizing sports betting in the state.
The bill, SB 690, now moves to the House for a vote.
If the House approves the bill and Governor J.B. Pritzker signs it into law, Illinois would become the 11th state to legalize sports betting.
How much revenue will Illinois generate from sports betting?

According to a study conducted by Oxford Economics for the American Gaming Association (AGA), Illinois could generate up to $375 million in annual gaming revenue from sports betting. 
This would include $225 million from wagers placed at casinos and racetracks, and an additional $150 million from online and mobile platforms.
The AGA study also found that legalization of sports betting would create 1,700 new jobs in Illinois.

Not everyone is convinced that legalizing sports betting will be a boon for Illinois. 
In a letter to legislators, Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel voiced opposition to the bill on grounds that it would “create an entirely new industry that preys on people’s propensity to bet on games.”
He also expressed concern that legalized sports betting would lead to increased crime and addiction rates.

Despite opposition from some quarters, it appears likely that Illinois will soon join the ranks of states with legal sports betting.
What kind of impact this will have on the state’s economy remains to be seen.

#  Illinois Poised to Cash In on Sports Betting Boom

The Illinois General Assembly is voting on a bill that would legalize sports betting in the state. The proposed legislation would allow for mobile and online betting, as well as betting at casinos and racetracks.

Illinois is one of several states considering sports betting legislation in the aftermath of the repeal of the federal ban on sports betting. New Jersey was the first state to take advantage of the change, launching its sports betting operation in June. Other states, including Pennsylvania and West Virginia, have also moved to legalize sports betting.

The potential revenue from sports betting is significant. A study by Eilers & Krejcik Gaming estimated that legalized sports betting could generate up to $1.8 billion in annual revenue in Illinois. That would make Illinois one of the most lucrative states for sports betting.

Legalized sports betting would also create jobs in Illinois. The Eilers & Krejcik study estimated that legalizing sports betting would create more than 2,300 jobs in the state.

There is strong support for legalizing sports betting in Illinois. A poll conducted by Southern Illinois University found that 73% of respondents supported legalizing sports betting.

Opposition to legal gambling has been waning in recent years. In addition to support for legalized sports betting, there is growing support for casino gambling and online gambling. This shift in public opinion has been driven in part by the legalization of marijuana nationwide.

If the bill passes, Illinois would join a growing number of states that offer legal Sports Betting

#  Illinois Sports Betting Could be Worth $2 Billion

As sports betting gradually becomes legalized in the United States, Illinois is poised to become a major player in the industry. The Prairie State has long been a destination for gambling, thanks to its many casinos and horse tracks. A recent study by Oxford Economics estimates that legalized sports betting could be worth up to $2 billion annually in Illinois, with over two-thirds of that coming from online wagers.

This would make Illinois one of the largest gaming markets in the country, just behind Nevada and New Jersey. The potential windfall from sports betting is already attracting interest from major casino operators like MGM Resorts and Caesars Entertainment. Both companies have already expressed an interest in setting up online operations in Illinois if sports betting is legalized.

There is strong bipartisan support for legalizing sports betting in Illinois, with lawmakers on both sides of the aisle recognizing its potential benefits. Last year, a bill was introduced in the state legislature that would have legalized sports betting and established a regulatory framework for the industry. While that bill did not make it out of committee, there is still a good chance that something will pass this year.

If sports betting does get legalized in Illinois, it could be a boon for the state's economy. Not only would it generate jobs and tax revenue, but it would also attract tourists who are interested in gambling. With so much at stake, it's no wonder that casino operators are drooling at the prospect of legalization.
