#  IRS levies a 10% tax on blackjack winnings

In March 2019, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) announced that it would begin levying a 10% tax on blackjack winnings. The levy, which is set to go into effect on July 1st, has drawn criticism from gamblers and casino owners alike.

Under the new rules, any blackjack player who wins more than $1,000 in a single hand will be required to pay 10% of their profits to the IRS. The tax will apply not only to winnings at brick-and-mortar casinos, but also to online gambling sites.

Casino owners have criticized the IRS for targeting an industry that already pays significant taxes. They argue that the new levy will lead to job losses and reduced investment in the casino industry.

Gamblers have also spoken out against the tax. Some argue that it is unfair to penalize gamblers for winning money. Others say that the tax will make it harder for them to make a living from gambling.

The IRS has defended the levy, arguing that it is necessary to ensure that blackjack players pay their fair share of taxes. The agency points out that blackjack is one of the most popular forms of gambling in the United States, and that its players should therefore be subject to taxation.

The debate over the blackjack tax is likely to continue well into 2020. Casino owners and gamblers are expected to lobby Congress heavily in an effort to get the tax repealed or reduced.

#  California casino payout taxes hit players hard

Walking into a casino in California, and many other states for that matter, residents may be unaware of the large tax bite that comes with any lucky winnings.

Generally, casinos are subject to a wagering tax, which is imposed on their net income from gaming activities. That tax amounts to a whopping 35 percent. However, in order to ensure that players don't simply walk away from the table with their winnings and avoid taxation, the state also imposes a payout tax on any payouts over $600. That payout tax is currently at 10 percent.

Combined, the two taxes can amount to a 45-percent take from a casino payout. And unfortunately for players, those taxes are applied not just to jackpots, but also to winning hands in poker or blackjack games.

While Nevada doesn't have a payout tax, it does have a higher wagering tax rate: 6.75 percent against Nevada casinos' net winnings. So while Nevada's overall gaming tax rate is lower than California's, the effective tax rate on payouts is actually higher in Nevada.

For big winners, the combined state and federal taxes can easily exceed 50 percent of the winnings. In some cases, they can reach as high as 80 percent. That's a huge chunk of change to give up to the government - especially considering that it was likely earned through hard work and luck.

There has been some discussion about whether or not these taxes are too steep, with some arguing that they serve as a discouragement for people to gamble and risk their money. Others maintain that the taxes are necessary in order to help offset costs associated with gambling addiction and other social problems related to gambling activity.

#  Is the IRS coming for your blackjack winnings?

As of right now, it seems that the answer is no. The IRS has not issued any new guidance on the taxation of blackjack winnings in light of the recent Supreme Court decision that legalized sports betting nationwide. However, this does not mean that you can necessarily assume that your blackjack winnings are tax-free.

The IRS has not released any definitive guidance on the matter, but it is reasonable to think that they will treat blackjack winnings in a similar manner to gambling winnings. Gambling winnings are generally taxable, although there are some exceptions. For example, you generally don't have to pay taxes on winnings from lotteries and raffles.

So, what does this mean for blackjack players? It's hard to say for sure, but it's probably a good idea to report any blackjack wins on your tax return. You may be able to claim them as gambling losses if you can prove that you lost more money at the casino than you won.

It's important to note that the rules surrounding gambling income and losses can be complicated, and there are many factors that can influence how much tax you may owe on your blackjack profits. For more information, consult a qualified tax professional.

#  Nevada casinos prep for new tax on jackpot payouts

Starting July 1st, Nevada casinos will be subject to a new 6.75% tax on jackpot payouts.

The new tax was approved by the Nevada legislature in June and is expected to raise an additional $2 million in revenue for the state each year.

Casino officials have not yet released any statements on how the new tax will impact their operations, but it is likely that players will notice a decrease in the size of jackpot payouts.

Nevada Governor Brian Sandoval praised the legislature's decision to pass the new tax, calling it "an important step in our efforts to maintain fiscal stability and fund essential government services."

#  Do you have to pay taxes on blackjack winnings?

When playing blackjack in a casino, one of the questions that players may have is whether they have to pay taxes on their winnings. The answer to this question is not a simple one, as it depends on a variety of factors.

Generally, if you are considered a professional gambler and are playing in order to make a living, then your winnings are considered taxable income. However, if you are simply playing for recreation and are not making a profit from your games, then your winnings are not subject to taxes.

There are also some exceptions to this rule. For example, if you live in Canada and win more than $10,000 from blackjack in a year, you will have to report your winnings as income. Similarly, if you live in the United States and win more than $5,000 in a year from blackjack (or any other type of gambling), you will have to report those earnings as taxable income.

So, overall, whether or not you have to pay taxes on your blackjack winnings depends on your individual circumstances. If you are unsure about what applies to you, it is always best to consult with an accountant or tax specialist.
