#  Casino says player exploitation led to blackjack dealer discovery

#  Casino investigating how blackjack dealer managed to get 21

The management of a popular casino is investigating how one of their blackjack dealers was able to get a 21 on two occasions in the past week. They believe that the dealer may have cheated in some way and are determined to find out how it was done.

The dealer, who has been with the casino for over five years, has denied any wrongdoing. He says that he simply got lucky on both occasions and that there is no way he could have cheated.

The casino has already spoken to the other dealers and staff who were working at the table at the time of the incidents. They are all adamant that nothing unusual happened and that the dealer simply got lucky.

The casino is now turning to surveillance footage in an attempt to find out how the dealer managed to get 21 twice in such a short period of time.

#  Player banned from casino after blackjack dealer discovery

A player has been banned from a casino after a blackjack dealer caught them counting cards.

The incident occurred at the MGM Grand in Detroit, where the dealer noticed the player was keeping track of the cards as they were played.

Once it became clear that the player was counting cards, the dealer alerted casino security, who subsequently banned the player from the premises.

This is not the first time that card counting has caused issues for players in casinos. In 2015, three players were banned from a casino in Atlantic City after they were caught counting cards.

Card counting is a technique used by players to improve their chances of winning at blackjack. By keeping track of the cards that have been played, players can estimate when high value cards are likely to be dealt next. This gives them an advantage over the casino, as they can make more informed betting decisions.

While card counting is not illegal, casinos frown upon it as it gives players an edge over the house. As a result, casinos often take measures to prevent players from using this technique, such as banning them from the premises.
