IGT slot machines are programmed to recognize when someone is trying to cheat the system by resetting the machine with a key. There are many ways to try to reset an IGT slot machine, but the most common way is to use a key.

To successfully reset an IGT slot machine using a key, you must first find the keyhole. The keyhole is typically located on the front or back of the machine. Once you have found the keyhole, insert the key into the hole and turn it clockwise until the machine resets.
