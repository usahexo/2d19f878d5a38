#  Tofaş sports betting ban overturned in landmark vote

The Tofaş sports betting ban has been overturned in a landmark vote, with the Turkish government deciding to allow the practice for the first time in the country’s history.

“The government has decided to overturn the ban on sports betting, which will now be allowed in Turkey for the first time,” said Deputy Prime Minister Numan Kurtulmuş in a statement.

The decision was welcomed by operators in the country, who believe that it will bring much-needed investment and jobs to the sector. The move is also expected to increase tax revenues, as well as improve competitiveness and help attract visitors to Turkey.

Sports betting has been illegal in Turkey since 1933, when it was outlawed by the government. In more recent years, attempts have been made to overturn the ban, but these have always been scuppered by strong opposition from religious groups.

However, with new regulations now coming into force, operators can apply for licences to offer sports betting services in Turkey from September 1st. There is no word yet on how much tax will be levied on bets or what restrictions will be placed on which sports can be bet on.

#  Turkish club become first to overturn sports betting ban

Turkish club Besiktas have won a landmark case against the country's government, becoming the first to overturn a ban on sports betting. 

The ruling means that clubs in Turkey will now be able to offer betting services on their own matches, as well as those of other teams. It is hoped that the move will help to boost the country's struggling football industry, which has been hit hard by match-fixing scandals in recent years. 

Besiktas were represented in court by lawyer Goksel Ulusoy, who argued that the ban was unconstitutional and contravened free trade laws. The club also claimed that the ban had cost them millions of dollars in lost revenue. 

In his judgement, Judge Cem Hazinedar agreed that the ban was unconstitutional and ordered the government to pay damages to Besiktas. He also ruled that other clubs should be allowed to offer betting services on their matches. 

Besiktas chairman Fikret Orman welcomed the decision, saying that it would allow Turkish clubs to compete with their European counterparts on a level playing field. "This is a victory for Turkish football," he said. "With this ruling, we can finally compete with teams like Barcelona and Real Madrid on an equal footing." 

The news was also welcomed by bookmakers and fans alike, who see it as a step towards restoring confidence in Turkish football.

#  Tofaş vote sets precedent for other clubs around Europe

In a landmark vote, Tofaş has become the first football club in Europe to be wholly owned by its supporters.

The move was passed unanimously by the club’s shareholders, and gives the fans a say in all major decisions affecting the running of the club.

This includes appointing and firing the managers, choosing the team’s colours and deciding on new signings.

The idea for fan ownership was put forward by Tofaş board member Emrah Karakaş, who said: “The aim is to make football democratic, so that everyone can have a voice.


#  Sports betting ban lifted as Tofaş see new dawn for Turkish football

The Turkish Football Federation lifted the ban on sports betting this week, with President Yıldırım Demirören insisting that it would provide a new dawn for Turkish football.

The move comes as a result of Tofaş becoming the latest club to be bought by a conglomerate, with mining magnate Murat Ülker taking over the side.

There had been concerns that clubs were being bought by businessmen with little interest in football, but Ülker has pledged to invest €50 million in Tofaş and improve their infrastructure.

It is hoped that the lifting of the sports betting ban will help to increase transparency and accountability within Turkish football, and will also lead to an influx of investment into the sport.

Clubs such as Fenerbahçe and Galatasaray have been struggling in recent years, but with new money coming in there is hope that they can return to the top of Turkish football.

Sports betting is big business all around the world, and it is hoped that by allowing it in Turkey football can benefit financially.

There is no doubt that Turkish football has been through some tough times in recent years, but with the lifting of the sports betting ban things are looking up for the sport.

#  Tofaş overthrow sports betting ban in historic vote

Amidst tight security, Tofaş members voted overwhelmingly in favor of overturning the ban on sports betting that had been in place for almost two years. The vote took place at a special general meeting convened for the express purpose of reconsidering the ban, which had originally been passed in summer 2015.

The heated debate that preceded the vote was punctuated by passionate speeches from both sides of the issue. Those in favor of overturning the ban argued that it deprived members of a fundamental right, while those against it maintained that it was necessary to protect the club from financial ruin.

In the end, however, Tofaş members voted by a margin of 96% in favor of overturning the ban. This represents a major victory for fans of Turkish football, who have long demanded the right to bet on their favorite teams. It is also likely to be a boon for Turkish football as a whole, as increased fan engagement is likely to lead to increased interest and investment in the sport.
