#  What is the objective of the game?

The objective of the game is to score as many points as possible by hitting the puck into the opponent’s goal.

#How do players score points?

Players can score points by hitting the puck into the opponent’s goal. The puck must completely cross the goal line in order for a player to be awarded a point. Players can also score a point by hitting the puck into their own goal.

#How is the game played?

The game is played on a sheet of ice with two teams of players. Each team has six players: one goaltender and five skaters. The game is divided into three periods, each lasting 20 minutes. At the end of each period, the team with the most goals scored is declared the winner. If at the end of regulation time, both teams have an equal number of goals, then an overtime period will be played.

#What are the basic rules of play?

The basic rules are as follows: 
1) The puck can be hit with any part of the body except for the hands and arms. 
2) A player cannot hold or tackle another player. 
3) A player cannot intentionally interfere with another player’s movement or pursue the puck offsides. 
4) A player cannot deliberately jump over the boards onto or off of the playing surface. 
5) The goaltender cannot leave his crease to challenge an opposing player except when playing the puck outside of his crease.
