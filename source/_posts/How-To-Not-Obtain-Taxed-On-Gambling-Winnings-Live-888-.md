#  How To Not Obtain Taxed On Gambling Winnings Live 888 

In numerous cases, people think that when they win money from gambling, a component of that money is automatically taxable. That's not always the case-- in fact, for many people, gambling income is not taxable at all. The Internal Revenue Service has very specific rules about when gambling winnings are taxed, and if you can follow those rules, you may be able to keep more of your hard-earned money.

The basic rule about gambling income and taxes is that any winnings are taxable, but only the wins that are considered "unnecessary" are taxed. In other words, if you can show that the amount you won was necessary to maintain your normal level of living, then the winnings are not taxable. For example, if you make $50,000 a year from your job and you win an additional $10,000 at the casino, then the $10,000 is considered unnecessary and is therefore taxable. However, if you were to win $10,000 while making only $20,000 from your job, then the $10,000 would be considered necessary and would not be taxable.

There are a few other things to keep in mind when it comes to gambling income and taxes: 

- Winnings from lotteries or raffles are always considered taxable. 
- Winnings from horse races or other sporting events are taxed only if they exceed certain amounts ($600 for individuals and $1,200 for married couples filing jointly). 
- Gambling losses can be deducted from gambling income when calculating how much tax is owed on the winnings. 

If you have any questions about how gambling income is taxed in your specific situation, it's best to speak with an accountant or tax specialist. But by following these general guidelines, you should be able to keep more of your hard-earned money in your pocket.

#  How Do I Avoid Paying Taxes On My Winnings? 

Like most people, you probably want to avoid paying taxes on your winnings if you can. The good news is that there are a few ways to do this.

The easiest way to avoid taxes on your winnings is to not report them to the IRS. This is a risky strategy, however, as the IRS may audit you and find out that you have been hiding income.

Another way to avoid paying taxes on your winnings is to claim them as gambling losses. This will offset any taxable income that you earn from gambling. Keep in mind, however, that you can only deduct gambling losses up to the amount of your gambling income.

If you have won a large amount of money, another option is to take out a loan and use the money to pay taxes on your winnings. This may not be the best option for everyone, but it can be a tax-effective way to pay taxes on your winnings.

Ultimately, the best way to avoid paying taxes on your winnings is to talk to a tax professional. They can help you figure out which strategy is best for you and make sure that you are doing everything correctly so that you don’t run into any problems with the IRS.

#  How To Gamble Online And Not Pay Taxes 

The internet has made it possible for people from all over the world to gamble online. This has been a great development for those who live in countries where gambling is not legal. However, there is one big downside to this – you can’t gamble without paying taxes.

Unless you live in a country like Portugal or the UK, where gambling is tax-free, you will have to pay taxes on any wins you make while gambling online. For example, if you win $1,000 while gambling online, you will have to pay around $250 in taxes. This can be a real pain, especially if you are just trying to make a bit of extra money.

There are a few ways that you can reduce the amount of taxes that you have to pay on your gambling profits. The first way is to only gamble on sites that are based in your home country. This will ensure that any profits you make are considered as taxable income in your home country and not in the country where the site is based.

The second way is to claim losses as well as profits on your tax return. If you lose $1,000 while gambling online, you can claim this as a loss on your return. This will reduce the amount of tax that you have to pay on your profits.

Finally, it’s important to remember that gambling profits are only taxed if they exceed your losses for the year. So, if you only make $500 in profits while gambling online, you won’t have to pay any taxes at all.

While none of these methods are perfect, they can help reduce the amount of tax that you have to pay on your gambling profits. So, if you want to gamble online without paying taxes, make sure that you use one of these methods!
