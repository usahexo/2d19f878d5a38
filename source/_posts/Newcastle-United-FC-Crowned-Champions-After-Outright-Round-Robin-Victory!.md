#  Newcastle United FC Crowned Champions After Outright Round Robin Victory!

Newcastle United Football Club can finally rejoice after a dominant season in the English Premier League, culminating in an outright championship victory!

Despite being tipped by many as relegation favourites, Rafa Benitez's side have confounded all expectations and emerged triumphant from a fiercely competitive round robin tournament.

A final day victory away at AFC Bournemouth saw Newcastle United finish 3 points clear of runners-up Liverpool, with Champions Manchester City a distant 5th.

"I'm so proud of my team," said ecstatic manager Rafa Benitez. "This is a club that has been through so much heartache in recent years, but we've battled through and proven everyone wrong. I'd like to thank the fans for their incredible support; they've been simply amazing."

Captain Jamaal Lascelles was equally ecstatic after lifting the trophy: "This is what it's all about! To captain Newcastle United to Premier League glory is a dream come true. We've worked so hard for this and I'm just delighted that we could do it in front of our own supporters."

The celebrations will undoubtedly be wild on Tyneside tonight, as Magpies fans toast their club's first ever outright Premier League title!

#  Newcastle United FC Secure Second Place in Round Robin Following Thrilling 3-2 Victory Over Chelsea FC! 

Newcastle United FC secured second place in the round robin tournament, following a thrilling 3-2 victory over Chelsea FC. Goals from Mohamed Diame and Ayoze Perez saw Newcastle come back from 2-0 down to snatch the win in the final minutes of the game.

The result moves Rafa Benitez’s side above Tottenham Hotspur into second place in Group H, and means they will now face La Liga giants Barcelona in the next stage of the competition. Chelsea FC finish third in the group and will take on Greek side PAOK Salonika.

It took just eight minutes for Chelsea to take the lead, with Olivier Giroud converting from close range after good work down the right from Marcos Alonso. The hosts doubled their advantage midway through the first half, as Eden Hazard finished off a well worked team move.

Newcastle pulled a goal back before halftime, as Mohamed Diame finished clinically following a flowing passing move. The Magpies then completed their comeback with two goals in quick succession in the closing stages of the match. First, Ayoze Perez latched onto a loose ball in the penalty area to fire home, before Perez himself set up Joselu for an easy finish to seal an incredible victory.

#  Liverpool FC Top Table After Winning Final Game of Round Robin Against Newcastle United FC! 

Liverpool FC have emerged triumphant after the final round robin game against Newcastle United FC. This win has lifted them to the top of the Premier League table, ahead of archrivals Manchester United FC who lost 1-0 to Chelsea FC.

This is a remarkable achievement by Liverpool FC, who were written off by many pundits before the start of the season. They have shown great resilience and tenacity to battle through what has been a difficult campaign so far. A big part of their success must be attributed to their manager, Jurgen Klopp, who has moulded the team into a formidable force. The players must also take credit for their hard work and dedication on the pitch.

The fans have been a huge boost for the team as well, with their passionate and enthusiastic support helping to spur them on to victory on occasions. It will be interesting to see how Liverpool FC fare in the coming weeks and months, as they bid to secure their first Premier League title in twenty-eight years.

#  Southampton FC Earn Seventh Place in Round Robin Thanks to Draw Against Newcastle United FC!

The Southampton FC team has achieved an impressive feat, earning seventh place in the round robin tournament due to their 1-1 draw against Newcastle United FC on Sunday. This concludes an eventful month for Southampton FC and manager Mauricio Pellegrino, who has faced much criticism from angry fans in light of the club’s lackluster performance thus far this season.

The south coast team was desperate for a strong result against Newcastle in order to salvage some dignity before the end of the year. They started the game brightly, with Nathan Redmond scoring in the eighth minute to give his side the lead. However, Newcastle equalized just before halftime through a well-taken goal by Matt Ritchie. The second half saw both teams create opportunities but ultimately fail to score, resulting in a hard-fought draw.

This result means that Southampton finish ahead of West Bromwich Albion and Stoke City but behind Everton and Leicester City. It also means that they will compete in next season’s Europa League qualifiers, although they are likely to face a tougher opponent than they would have had they finished lower down in the table.

In spite of this positive result, there is still much work to be done at Southampton FC if they are to improve their league position next season. Fans have been calling for Pellegrino’s dismissal ever since he was hired back in June, and it seems unlikely that their opinion of him will change any time soon.

#  AFC Bournemouth End Season on a Positive Note with Dominant Victory Over Newcastle United FC

AFC Bournemouth finished their 2018-19 English Premier League (EPL) season with a comprehensive 5-0 victory over Newcastle United FC at the Vitality Stadium. The win saw the Cherries jump to 12th place in the standings, one point above relegation-threatened Cardiff City FC and three points ahead of 18th-place Southampton FC.

Bournemouth got off to a flying start, taking the lead in the eighth minute through Joshua King's close-range volley. Nathan Ake made it 2-0 in the 33rd minute with a header from Ryan Fraser's free kick, and Callum Wilson added a third just before halftime, tapping home from six yards out after good work from David Brooks on the wing.

Wilson completed his brace in the 53rd minute, drilling a left-footed shot past Martin Dubravka from just outside the area, and Fraser added the fifth in injury time with a superb curling effort from 25 yards out. It was an emphatic end to what has been a frustrating season for Eddie Howe's men, who have spent much of 2018-19 battling relegation.

"It was important to finish on a high note," said Howe after the game. "The players showed great character and guts today. We could have played better at times, but we'll take the five goals."

Howe will now turn his attention to next season, when he will hope to lead Bournemouth back into more stable waters. The Cherries will be looking to improve on their current 12th place finish and secure a spot in the top half of the table - something that looked unlikely at various points this season.

Key players such as King, Wilson and Brooks will be crucial if Bournemouth are to achieve this goal, and they will no doubt be keen to put together another strong showing next year after ending their latest campaign on a high.
