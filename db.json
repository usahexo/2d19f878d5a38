It was also created as a way to promote self-care and relaxation. National Comfy day is celebrated annually on November 22nd.\n\nThere are many benefits to taking a break and relaxing. When you’re stressed, your body releases cortisol, which is a hormone that can have negative effects on your health if it’s released in high levels over long periods of time. Relaxing can help to lower your stress levels and prevent the release of cortisol.\n\nRelaxing can also improve your mood. When you’re stressed, it’s common to feel overwhelmed, anxious, or frustrated. Relaxing can help to calm these feelings and make you feel happier overall.\n\nTaking a break also allows you to restore your energy levels. When you’re constantly engaged in activities, your energy reserves start to deplete. This can lead to feeling tired and run down. Taking some time for yourself can help to recharge your batteries so that you feel more energized when you return to your activities.\n\nFinally, relaxing can improve your focus and productivity. When you’re stressed out, it’s difficult to focus on tasks and stay productive. Relaxing can help you clear your mind and focus better on the tasks at hand.\n\nIf you’re looking for ways to relax, National Comfy day is a great opportunity to start. There are many different ways to relax, so find what works best for you and take some time for yourself!","source":"_posts/What-is-National-Comfy-Day-.md","raw":"---\ntitle: What is National Comfy Day \ndate: 2022-08-17 23:08:27\ncategories:\n- Comfy Day\ntags:\n- Comfy Day\n- National Comfy Day\n---\n\n\n#  What is National Comfy Day? \n\nNational Comfy Day is an unofficial holiday that is celebrated on October 28th.
