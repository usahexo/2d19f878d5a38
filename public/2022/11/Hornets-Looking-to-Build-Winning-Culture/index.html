        <h1 id="Hornets-Looking-to-Build-Winning-Culture"><a href="#Hornets-Looking-to-Build-Winning-Culture" class="headerlink" title="Hornets Looking to Build Winning Culture"></a>Hornets Looking to Build Winning Culture</h1><p>The Charlotte Hornets look to rebound from a disappointing season and return to the playoffs. Despite losing Kemba Walker, the Hornets have a solid foundation of talent with Jeremy Lamb, Miles Bridges, and Tony Parker. They also drafted PJ Washington who could be a steal at number 12 overall. The Hornets are looking to build a winning culture and win now.</p>
<p>The Eastern Conference is wide open with the departure of LeBron James and the ascendance of young stars such as Giannis Antetokounmpo, Joel Embiid, and Ben Simmons. The Celtics and Bucks are the favorites in the East, but the Raptors, Sixers, Pacers, Pistons, and Bulls all have a shot at making the playoffs.</p>
<p>The Hornets should be contenders for one of the last two playoff spots in the East. With Walker gone, they will need to find another player to take over as the go-to guy in crunch time. Lamb is capable of carrying the load but will need to improve his shooting from last year.</p>
<p>Bridges showed great potential in his rookie season and should continue to develop into a solid player. He has great athleticism and can score in multiple ways. Parker is coming off a down year but is still one of the best point guards in the league. He will be a mentor to Washington and help him transition to the NBA game.</p>
<p>The Hornets have a good mix of veterans and young players who can compete now and in the future. Coach James Borrego has his work cut out for him but should be able to get this team into the playoffs.</p>
<h1 id="Hornets-Hope-to-Turn-Things-Around-in-2017"><a href="#Hornets-Hope-to-Turn-Things-Around-in-2017" class="headerlink" title="Hornets Hope to Turn Things Around in 2017"></a>Hornets Hope to Turn Things Around in 2017</h1><p>Last season was a tough one for the Charlotte Hornets. They finished with a 36-46 record, missing the playoffs for the second consecutive year. In order to turn things around in 2017, the Hornets will need to improve their play on both sides of the ball.</p>
<p>Offense</p>
<p>The Hornets’ biggest weakness last season was their offense. They averaged just 101.8 points per game, which ranked 24th in the NBA. To improve this area of their game, they will need to get more from their starters. Kemba Walker is coming off a disappointing season in which he averaged just 17.7 points per game. He will need to be more aggressive and take more shots if the Hornets hope to score more points this season. Nicolas Batum also struggled offensively last season, averaging just 12.9 points per game. He will need to find his groove again if the Hornets want to be successful offensively.</p>
<p>Defense</p>
<p>The Hornets were also poor defensively last season, giving up 107.3 points per game, which ranked 21st in the NBA. In order to improve this area of their game, they will need to get better production from their starters. Michael Kidd-Gilchrist is coming off a solid defensive season in which he averaged 1.5 blocks per game. He will need to continue playing at a high level on defense if the Hornets hope to improve their defensive rating. Dwight Howard had a disappointing first season with the Hornets in which he averaged just 1.6 blocks per game. He will need to play at an All-Star level on defense if Charlotte wants to be successful defensively this season.</p>
<h1 id="Hornet’s-Management-has-High-Hopes-for-the-Future"><a href="#Hornet’s-Management-has-High-Hopes-for-the-Future" class="headerlink" title="Hornet’s Management has High Hopes for the Future"></a>Hornet’s Management has High Hopes for the Future</h1><p>Hornet’s management has high hopes for the future. The company plans to grow its market share by expanding its product line and increasing its marketing efforts.</p>
<p>The company’s new products include a line of smart home devices that can be controlled with a smartphone app. These devices include a smart thermostat, a smart smoke detector, and a smart security system.</p>
<p>Hornet’s also plans to increase its marketing efforts in order to reach more consumers. The company will use TV advertising, online advertising, and social media marketing to promote its products.</p>
<h1 id="Hornets-Building-for-Long-Term-Success"><a href="#Hornets-Building-for-Long-Term-Success" class="headerlink" title="Hornets Building for Long-Term Success"></a>Hornets Building for Long-Term Success</h1><p>% The Charlotte Hornets have been among the NBA’s most consistent franchises over the past decade, making the playoffs eight times and reaching the Eastern Conference Finals twice.</p>
<p>%Owner Michael Jordan has put a lot of faith in head coach James Borrego, who is in his first full season with the team.</p>
<p>%With a young core led by Kemba Walker and Dwight Howard, the Hornets are looking to build for sustained success in the future.</p>
<p>%Here are three reasons why the Hornets are poised for long-term success:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>A strong foundation built on youth and experience</p>
</li>
<li><p>A passionate fan base that will stick with them through thick and thin</p>
</li>
<li><p>An ownership group that is committed to winning</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="Hornets-Excited-About-Future-with-New-Leadership"><a href="#Hornets-Excited-About-Future-with-New-Leadership" class="headerlink" title="Hornets Excited About Future with New Leadership"></a>Hornets Excited About Future with New Leadership</h1><p>The Charlotte Hornets are looking forward to the future with new ownership and leadership. Owner Michael Jordan has brought in new leadership in the form of Mitch Kupchak as President of Basketball Operations and Coach James Borrego. Kupchak is a former General Manager of the Los Angeles Lakers, and Borrego is a former assistant coach for the San Antonio Spurs.</p>
<p>The Hornets are coming off a disappointing season where they finished with a record of 36-46. However, there are many reasons for optimism for the future.</p>
<p>First and foremost, Kemba Walker is one of the best point guards in the NBA. He averaged 22.1 points per game last season and was selected to his third All-Star Game. With Walker leading the way, the Hornets should be competitive in most games.</p>
<p>In addition, the Hornets have two young players who could breakout this season. First is Malik Monk, who was selected with the 11th overall pick in the 2017 draft. Monk averaged 9.3 points per game as a rookie and showed flashes of being a very talented player. The other player is Miles Bridges, who was selected 12th overall in this year’s draft. Bridges played one year at Michigan State and averaged 17.1 points per game. He is a versatile player who can score from anywhere on the court.</p>
<p>Of course, it remains to be seen how well Kupchak and Borrego will be able to get these young players to perform on the court. But there is certainly potential for improvement this season and beyond.</p>
